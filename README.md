# First 100 problems Project Euler.py
I'm pushing here the solutions of the first 100 [Project Euler's](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems. I'll always use Python.
This repository is a work in progress, I don't know how much it will take to solve all 100, but I will do it.  
## Why are you doing this?
- There is not an updated source that does what this repository does.
- This could be very helpful to everyone who wants to check if its solution could be improved or to anyone who is not figuring out how to solve a problem and so needs a   guide.
- This project forces me to write better code, because I know that it will be read by others.
- Others will surely find flaws in my code, and that will make me a better programmer.  
## Why the first 100?
Because [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) tells us that we can publish only the solutions of the first 100 projects.

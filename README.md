# First 100 problems Project Euler.py
I'm pushing here the solutions of the first 100 [Project Euler's](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems. I'll always use Python.
This repository is a work in progress, I don't know how much it will take to solve all 100, but I will do it.  
## Why are you doing this?
- There is not an updated source that does what this repository does.
- This will improve other people's code.
- The repository will help everyone who needs a guide to solve a problem.
- This project forces me to write better code, because I know that it will be read by others.
- Others will surely find flaws in my code, and that will make me a better programmer.  
## Why the first 100?
Because [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) tells us that we can publish only the solutions of the first 100 projects.
## What if I don't get a solution?
I'll be glad to help you, you can contact me on Discord @Gioack#3001, on [LinkedIn @Leonardo Boscolo Gioachina](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/?trk=organization_guest_nav-header-logo) or on [Instagram @geography_addicted_](https://z-p3.www.instagram.com/geography_addicted_/).
